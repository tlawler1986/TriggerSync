## 📘 Description
 Hi, my name is Tim Lawler. I'm an avid and passionate firearms enthusiast—and self-proclaimed firearm "hoarder." Ever since my time with 7th Group starting in 2006, I've been steadily building my collection of firearms, ammunition, and accessories.  That collection grew even more once I left the military and started contracting overseas. You could call it an expensive hobby of mine... well, that and tattoos, haha.  I've always wanted a simple way to keep track of what I have. So I built <strong>TriggerSync</strong>—a clean, user-friendly tool to manage your firearms, ammo, and gear.  Honestly, the biggest reason? To get my wife off my A$@ about organizing my growing collection, haha.  I hope you enjoy using it and check back for updates! Oh, and yes—I do have a boat. If you know, you know. 😉

# How to use the App
1. Just like any typical website that contains a database, the potention user will have to sign up for an account, with name, email, username and password
2. Once the account is created and logged in, the user will have access to their inventory page, which allows to add, edit, delete firearms and ammunition.
3. Creating an account also gives the user access to the community page, allowing that user to view other people's inventory and notes left on each firearm.
4. Further updates would include a search box, and the ability to message other user's directly to obtain more information or to chat about specific firearms.

 # 🚀 Next Steps
[Link to my Trello Board for future updates](https://trello.com/b/khXfJOLp)
 - [   ] Adding a search box, so a user can search for a specific user or firearm.  It'll show that user's inventory, or users that own that specific firearm.
 - [   ] Adding the ability to message other users.  After viewing a user's inventory, and reading their specific notes on a firearm, another user would be able to message them to obtain more information on the specific firearm.  For individuals that may be on the fence about purchasing that specific firearm.
