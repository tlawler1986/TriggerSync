  <h2>About the Creator</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, my name is Tim Lawler. I'm an avid and passionate firearms enthusiastâ€”and self-proclaimed firearm "hoarder." Ever since my time with 7th Group starting in 2006, I've been steadily building my collection of firearms, ammunition, and accessories.
    <br><br>
    That collection grew even more once I left the military and started contracting overseas. You could call it an expensive hobby of mine... well, that and tattoos, haha.
    <br><br>
    I've always wanted a simple way to keep track of what I have. So I built <strong>TriggerSync</strong>â€”a clean, user-friendly tool to manage your firearms, ammo, and gear. 
    <br><br>
    Honestly, the biggest reason? To get my wife off my A$@ about organizing my growing collection, haha.
    <br><br>
    I hope you enjoy using it and check back for updates! 
    <br>
    Oh, and yesâ€”I do have a boat. If you know, you know. ðŸ˜‰
